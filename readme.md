# FUFDF-
FUFDF Sqli Injection Tool (BETA) (too much bug) 

My Security Tool is a versatile security testing tool designed for detecting login panels on websites and performing SQL injection testing. It provides a range of features to help you assess the security of web applications.

## Features

- **Login Panel Detection**: Quickly identify login panels on web pages, making it easier to target authentication vulnerabilities.

- **SQL Injection Testing**: Test web applications for SQL injection vulnerabilities using various payloads and customizable categories.

- **Concurrency**: Utilize multi-threading for efficient scanning and testing.

- **Proxy Support**: Test web applications through a proxy server to assess how they handle requests from different sources.

- **Random User-Agent**: Generate random User-Agents to make your requests appear more like those from real browsers.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with My Security Tool:

1. **Installation**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Usage**:
   - Run the tool from the command line using the following options:
     ```
     python main.py --url [target URL] --sqli --category [payload category] --proxy [proxy URL]
     ```
     - `--url`: Specify the target URL.
     - `--sqli`: Enable SQL injection testing.
     - `--category`: Specify the SQL injection payload category (e.g., generic_sql_injection).
     - `--proxy`: Provide a proxy URL if testing through a proxy server.

3. **Results**:
   - The tool will log results to separate log files, including login detection results and SQL injection errors.

4. **Customization**:
   - Customize SQL payloads by adding them to the `payloads` directory.
   - Modify the `config/settings.py` file to adjust login detection patterns and other settings.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use My Security Tool:

- Detect login panels on a website:
python main.py --url https://example.com --login

- Perform SQL injection testing with a custom payload category:
python main.py --url https://example.com --sqli --category custom_sql_injection
